### 🔍 Project Overview
This research focuses on using predictive modeling to evaluate dental treatment outcomes in pediatric patients. The study applies machine learning techniques to classify success rates of apexogenesis procedures based on demographic and procedural variables.

### 🧠 Data Science Contributions
- **Data Cleaning & Structuring**: Parsed unstructured treatment logs and cleaned 1,000+ patient records using R and SPSS
- **Feature Engineering**: Generated model-ready features from clinical text, procedural codes, and age groups
- **Modeling Techniques**: 
  - Logistic Regression
  - CART (Classification and Regression Tree)
  - Evaluation metrics: AUC, Accuracy, Cross-validation
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Chi-square tests for variable association
  - Variable importance analysis for outcome drivers

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
`R`, `SPSS`, `Excel`, `ggplot2`, `R Markdown`

### 🧾 Reproducibility
The full pipeline was built using **R Markdown** for transparent and shareable reporting. All data wrangling steps, model fitting processes, and statistical evaluations were documented to ensure clinical reproducibility.
